# Decisions

Choices that shape this cluster, why they were made, and what was rejected. The
point of the "rejected" column is to stop settled questions being reopened every
few months — if an entry says **settled**, it is not a to-do.

Add an entry when a choice is made that a later reader would otherwise mistake for
an oversight. Amend an entry when the reasoning changes; mark it **superseded** and
say why rather than deleting it.

## 1. Developers authenticate as their GitHub identity

**Settled.** Dex federates to GitHub, and the API server trusts Dex through a
JWTAuthenticator. A developer *is* their GitHub login; a team is a GitHub team.
There are no ServiceAccount tokens to distribute.

**Why.** Project developers are volunteers. Most are not in Scouterna's Entra
tenant and should not have to be, and GitHub is where they already are. It also
keeps RBAC portable: bindings name GitHub teams rather than tenant-specific object
IDs.

**Rejected: managed Entra integration (`aadProfile`) with Azure RBAC.** It would
require every developer to exist as a user or guest in the tenant, and would tie
RBAC to Entra object IDs against the portability goal. Secondary objections:
enabling it cannot be undone on an existing cluster, and its interaction with the
JWTAuthenticator is untested. **This is not pending a test** — the identity model
is the reason, and a test cannot change it.

**Cost, accepted.** The JWTAuthenticator is an AKS preview feature applied
out-of-band with `az` ([install.md](install.md) §8b), so the developer path depends
on a preview capability. Revocation is removing someone from the GitHub team, which
takes effect on their next login; an already-issued token stays valid until it
expires (`idTokens: 24h`).

See [cluster-access.md](cluster-access.md).

## 2. The static cluster-admin certificate stays

**Settled, as a consequence of 1.** `az aks get-credentials --admin` remains
available. [install.md](install.md) §12 deletes the file after bootstrap, but the
capability cannot be removed.

**Why.** `disableLocalAccounts` is the property that would remove it, and AKS
rejects it on a cluster without Entra integration — in ARM preflight, not at the
Bicep type level: *"Since kubernetes version 1.25, disableLocalAccounts can only be
set on Azure AD integration enabled cluster."* Confirmed 2026-07-21 and again
2026-08-18 against API `2026-03-01` on Kubernetes 1.36. Entra is ruled out by 1, so
the precondition is permanently unavailable.

**Superseded: setting `disableLocalAccounts: true` in Bicep.** Attempted, and
reverted — it fails preflight, which would have broken the `nodeCount`
bump-and-redeploy workflow on first use. Worth recording *why* it looked fine: the
property is valid, so `bicep build` accepted it and a CI check confirmed it reached
the resource. Both verify the type system; the constraint lives in AKS preflight.
`az deployment group validate` is the check that catches this class.

**The control instead.** The Azure rights permitting `az aks get-credentials
--admin` are the only route to cluster-admin outside SSO, so they are the real
mitigation: `Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role` and RG `Contributor` to
as few people as possible, PIM-eligible rather than standing.

## 3. Project namespaces enforce `baseline`, not `restricted`

**Current, deliberately revisitable.** Both namespace templates set
`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline`, with `restricted` as `warn` and
`audit`.

**Why.** `baseline` rejects the class of pod that reaches the node — privileged,
host namespaces, `hostPath`, `hostPort`, added capabilities — which is what makes
namespace `admin` safe on a single-node cluster. `restricted` additionally forbids
running as root in the container, which breaks a large share of upstream images
without closing anything `baseline` leaves open.

**Rejected for now: `enforce: restricted`.** Setting it as `warn`/`audit` shows
projects what a tightening would require while nothing breaks, which is the path to
adopting it later. Tightening is a real option, not a formality — it just needs the
warnings to be clean first.

**Not available: a cluster-wide default.** A managed AKS cluster does not accept an
`--admission-control-config-file`, so an unlabelled namespace cannot be made to
default to `restricted`. The labels are the whole mechanism, which is why CI asserts
they are present.

See [security.md](security.md) §2.

## 4. Pod Security `enforce-version` is pinned

**Current.** Project namespaces pin `enforce-version` to the cluster's minor
(`v1.36`); `warn` and `audit` are deliberately left unpinned.

**Why.** Admission behaviour should not change under running workloads because the
control plane moved — the same "pin everything, upgrade deliberately" rule the rest
of the platform follows. Leaving `warn`/`audit` unpinned means the newer level's
findings are visible before it is enforced.

**Cost, accepted.** The pin does not follow an AKS upgrade: after moving to 1.37 the
namespaces still enforce 1.36 semantics, silently. Bumping it is a separate commit
after the cluster upgrade — recorded under AKS upgrades in
[maintenance.md](maintenance.md).

**Rejected: `enforce-version: latest`.** It tracks the control plane, which is the
thing the pin exists to prevent. CI rejects it, because it is a valid PSA value and
would otherwise pass unnoticed.

## 5. IMDS egress is denied with a deny rule, not an allow-list

**Current.** A `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` denies egress to
`169.254.169.254/32` from every namespace except `kube-system`, with
`enableDefaultDeny: {egress: false, ingress: false}`.

**Why a deny rule.** In Cilium, an endpoint selected by any *allow* egress rule
flips to default-deny egress. A cluster-wide allow-list would have to enumerate
every legitimate destination of every pod, and one omission is an outage. A deny
rule cannot break traffic it does not mention.

**Why `NotIn [kube-system]`** rather than naming project namespaces: a namespace
created later is denied by default, so a new infra component that needs the node
identity fails visibly at deploy time instead of a new project quietly inheriting
the escalation path.

**Not done: a default-deny NetworkPolicy baseline.** Pod-to-pod traffic is still
unrestricted. Projects *may* ship their own `NetworkPolicy` (their AppProject
whitelists the kind); a platform-wide baseline needs a real project to test
against. Also not covered: the WireServer at `168.63.129.16`, which serves platform
DNS and health probes and so needs its own analysis.

See [security.md](security.md) §1.

## 6. External Secrets write access is not in `admin`, and the store is scoped

**Current.** `rbac.aggregateToAdmin` and `rbac.aggregateToEdit` are false, so the
operator's write permissions are not folded into the built-in roles. The
`ClusterSecretStore` carries `spec.conditions` naming the six infra namespaces that
use it, plus a `scouterna.se/keyvault-access: "true"` selector for project
namespaces.

**Why both.** The RBAC half is load-bearing: project namespaces must remain
eligible for the store, because a project with a database reads its password from
the vault, so scoping alone would not have closed the path. Turning off the
aggregation removes the capability instead of narrowing where it applies.

`rbac.aggregateToView` stays **on**: read-only access lets a developer see whether
their own secret synced, exposing the key name but never the value.

**Worth knowing before re-enabling either flag.** The aggregated role covered 23
resources, not just `externalsecrets` — including `PushSecret`/`ClusterPushSecret`,
which write *into* the vault, and the generator kinds, one of which (`Webhook`)
makes the controller issue an arbitrary HTTP request and capture the response into
a Secret. `aggregateToView` is the flag for granting read.

See [security.md](security.md) §3.

## 7. The vault has no per-key scoping

**Accepted limit.** Membership of the store's `conditions` grants read access to
the *whole* vault. The limit is which namespaces may use the store, not which keys
they may read.

**Why accepted.** Real per-project scoping needs a separate managed identity per
project, Azure RBAC assigned at **secret** scope, and a `SecretStore` per project to
use it — per-project Azure work on every onboarding. Not justified while the
projects are few and infra-run.

**What follows.** Treat presence in `conditions` as "trusted with every secret in
the vault", keep the vault's own role assignments minimal, and put only what a
namespace needs into it. Revisit when the first project the infra group does not run
needs vault access.

## 8. A namespace is a security boundary; the AppProject is not the only one

**Current.** With `baseline` Pod Security and the IMDS deny in place, a project
namespace is a boundary rather than a convenience.

**Why this needs stating.** The AppProject whitelist is labelled the security
boundary, and for the GitOps path it is one. But the platform deliberately allows
projects to deploy **by hand** with `kubectl`, which never passes through ArgoCD —
so for that route the boundary is Kubernetes RBAC plus Pod Security, and the two do
not match exactly. `admin` permits `RoleBinding`, `Role`, `ServiceAccount` and
`Secret` in its own namespaces even though the AppProject excludes them.

**What follows.** The excluded-kinds table in [onboarding.md](onboarding.md) is a
statement of ownership, not purely a technical fence: creating those by hand is out
of bounds and gets reverted. Closing the gap technically would need a
`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`, which is not deployed.

## 9. Audit logging is `kube-audit-admin` only, capped, and off-cluster

**Current.** A diagnostic setting on the cluster ships the `kube-audit-admin`
category to a Log Analytics workspace in the durable infra RG, capped at 1 GB/day
with 30-day retention.

**Why off-cluster, in the durable RG.** An audit log exists to answer "what
happened", including when what happened is the cluster being destroyed. Storing it
inside the cluster, or in the cluster's own resource group, means the one event
you most need it for takes it with it.

**Why `kube-audit-admin` and not `kube-audit`.** `kube-audit-admin` drops
non-mutating reads. `kube-audit` is the full firehose — several GB/day on an idle
cluster — which on a metered workspace is the entire budget.

Be clear about what that costs, because it is not merely noise: **reads are not
recorded.** `kubectl get secrets -A -o yaml` — which retrieves the Sealed Secrets
sealing key and every project credential — is a `get`/`list`, so it leaves no
trace. Nor does a developer probing across a namespace boundary, whose 403s are
also reads. So this records **who changed what, and who shelled into a pod**
(`exec`, `attach`, `portforward` and `TokenRequest` are all `create`), and not who
read what. Recovering the read side means auditing Key Vault, not raising this
category — see "What this does not give".

**Why not `guard`.** That category audits managed **Entra ID** authentication and
Azure RBAC decisions. This cluster deliberately uses neither (decision 1), so it
would emit nothing. Worth stating because `guard` is the standard recommendation
and appears in most AKS hardening guides — it is simply not applicable here.

**The cap loses data, deliberately.** At 1 GB/day, ingestion **stops** for the rest
of the UTC day once the cap is hit, and the workspace keeps reporting healthy. That
is an audit gap precisely when something is generating unusual API traffic — the
moment you would most want the log. The alternative is an uncapped metered resource
on a cluster with no spend alerting, which for a volunteer-run NGO is the worse
failure. Raise `dailyQuotaGb` if that judgement is wrong; the trade is explicit
rather than hidden.

**It is also cheap to abuse, and that needs no Azure rights.** A developer with
`admin` in one namespace can loop a mutating call — every request is logged — and
fill 1 GB in minutes, after which everything they do is unrecorded until the UTC
day rolls over. The flood itself is visible in the rows ingested before the cap,
but only to someone looking. The Azure-side cap alert below is what makes it
noticed rather than merely recorded.

**30 days interactive, one year archived.** Log Analytics includes 31 days of
interactive retention at no extra cost, so 30 is the longest queryable window with
no per-GB-month charge. Beyond that the rows move to **archive** for a total of 365
days: an incident here will surface incidentally and late (see below), and archive
storage is a fraction of ingestion cost, so a year of recoverable history is cheap
insurance. Searching the archive needs a search job or restore rather than a plain
query — slower, but it exists.

This is applied as a step in [install.md](install.md) §11 rather than in
`loganalytics.bicep`, because the resource-specific `AKSAuditAdmin` table does not
exist until the cluster's diagnostic setting has created it — and §5b runs before
the cluster does. It could move into Bicep if the table turns out to be
pre-configurable; nobody has established that.

**Retention is not retroactive, which makes that step matter more than it looks.**
Raising retention later does not recover rows that have already aged out — they are
gone. So the §11 step is not tidying-up to be done eventually: every day it is
deferred on a running cluster silently spends a day of history the archive was
supposed to keep. On a rebuild it is durable, since the workspace outlives the
cluster and the table setting persists with it.

**What this does not give.** Attribution for the local admin certificate is still
Azure-side only — requests arrive as `masterclient` whatever the audit log records
(see [cluster-access.md](cluster-access.md)). And **Key Vault reads are not
audited**: no diagnostic setting exists on the vault, so there is no record of which
secrets were read from the cluster's root of trust. Given that this category cannot
record Kubernetes reads either, that is the notable remaining gap — it is the half
of the original finding this change does not close, and it stays listed in
[maintenance.md](maintenance.md). **Alerting for this workspace is Azure-side.**
In-cluster alerting now exists (entry 11), but this workspace never depended on it
and still should not — these rules must fire when the cluster is the problem:
`infra/alerts.bicep` carries an action group with an email receiver and two rules,
deployed outside the cluster so they still fire when the cluster is the problem.

- **`audit-pipeline-deleted`** — an Activity Log alert on
  `Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/delete` and
  `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/delete`. This is the tamper case:
  deleting either stops collection silently, and the Activity Log is the only place
  it is recorded. Scoped to the subscription, because the point is to catch a delete
  wherever it happens.
- **`audit-ingestion-capped`** — a log query rule on `_LogOperation`, firing when the
  daily cap stops ingestion. Without it the cap is invisible: the workspace keeps
  reporting healthy while dropping everything, which is what makes the cap abusable
  rather than merely inconvenient.

**Cost, stated precisely rather than as "free".** The action group and the Activity
Log alert cost nothing. The cap rule is an Azure Monitor **log** alert and is billed
per rule per month — small, but not zero. If that is unwanted, delete the rule and
rely on the quarterly `dataIngestionStatus` check in
[maintenance.md](maintenance.md) instead; the trade is detection latency measured in
months rather than minutes.

**The workspace may contain secret material, and is treated as though it does.**
`AKSAuditAdmin` has `RequestObject` and `ResponseObject` columns — "Kubernetes API
object from the request in object format" — and a `Level` column whose values
include `RequestResponse`. This category records `create`, `update` and `patch`,
which are exactly the verbs External Secrets uses to materialise a Secret. If AKS
populates those columns for `secrets`, then the Sealed Secrets private key, the
telemetry store's root credentials and every project's PostgreSQL password are in
this workspace in plaintext — base64 is an encoding, not encryption — and read
access to it is equivalent to read access to every secret in the cluster.

**Whether it actually does is unverified**, and deliberately recorded as open
rather than assumed either way. The columns and the audit level are documented;
what AKS's managed audit policy emits for `secrets` on this cluster is not, and
there is no workspace yet to query. Settle it once §5b has run:

```kusto
AKSAuditAdmin
| where ObjectRef.resource == "secrets" and Verb in ("create","update","patch")
| project TimeGenerated, Verb, ObjectRef, Level, RequestObject
| take 5
```

If `RequestObject` carries the Secret's `data`, either drop it at ingestion with a
workspace transformation — `AKSAuditAdmin` supports DCR transformations, so the
column can be redacted for `ObjectRef.resource == "secrets"` before it is
stored — or accept it and say so here, in which case the workspace is a
secret-tier resource and its RBAC has to match the vault's. Amend this entry with
the answer rather than leaving the question implicit.

**Reading the audit log is a separate grant.** `enableLogAccessUsingOnlyResourcePermissions`
is `false`, so querying requires a role on the workspace itself — not merely `Reader`
on the cluster. That matters because the same Azure rights that mint the admin
certificate would otherwise also read the record of what it did — and, given the
paragraph above, possibly the secrets themselves. Until the query settles that,
this setting is load-bearing rather than merely conservative, and should not be
relaxed to `true` for query convenience.

Follow that through when granting access: **treat read on this workspace as read on
every secret in the cluster**, and hand it out on that basis — the same bar as a
role on the Key Vault, not the bar for a monitoring dashboard. A year of archived
rows widens that, not narrows it.

**Why a year and not 30 days.** With no detection in place, an incident will
surface incidentally — a project reports something odd, a bill looks wrong, a
credential turns up somewhere — which is routinely months, not weeks. A 30-day
window would mean that in the most likely timeline the answer to "who did this" had
already been deleted, while the control still read as present. It would also be
shorter than the 90-day Azure Activity Log it exists to be correlated with. The
archive closes both gaps for a small fraction of the ingestion cost.

**This workspace is audit-dedicated.** Anything else pointed at it — Defender for
Containers especially — would compete for the same 1 GB and could blind the audit
log as a side effect of adding a security control. Give it its own workspace or
recalculate the cap first.

## 10. The template declares the outbound IP counts

**Current.** `aks.bicep` sets `networkProfile.loadBalancerProfile.managedOutboundIPs`
to `count: 1` and `countIPv6: 1`, matching what the cluster is actually running.

**Why it has to be declared.** The cluster is dual-stack, and ARM's default for
`countIPv6` is **0** — outbound IPv6 is opt-in, unlike `count`, which defaults to
1. Azure allocated the v6 outbound IP when the cluster was created, but the
template never mentioned it. An incremental redeploy therefore reset it to the
default: `what-if` against the live test cluster showed
`managedOutboundIPs.countIPv6: 1 → 0`, which drops the cluster's IPv6 outbound
address and IPv6 egress with it, while AAAA records still resolve to the cluster.

**Why that mattered more than it looks.** The redeploy path is routine, not
exceptional — `aks.bicep`'s own `nodeCount` description calls bumping it and
redeploying *the* way to add a node (autoscaling is deliberately off), and
enabling the audit diagnostic setting on an existing cluster needs the same
redeploy. So the trap sat on the ordinary
scaling path, and would have been discovered as broken IPv6 egress some time after
an unrelated change.

**The general rule this is an instance of.** *A property Azure defaults and the
template does not declare is not stable — it is whatever the last write said.*
`what-if` is what surfaces it, and only against a **live** cluster; `bicep build`
cannot, since nothing is syntactically wrong. Worth running before any redeploy of
an existing cluster, and worth reading past the noise: read-only computed fields
like `effectiveOutboundIPs` always show as `Delete` and mean nothing, while a
`Modify` with a concrete before/after is real.

**Not addressed here:** the other properties in the same `what-if` output
(`nodeResourceGroup`, `storageProfile`, `windowsProfile`, `identityProfile` and
similar) also appear as `Delete`. Those are Azure-defaulted and left alone by an
incremental deploy — verified by the same what-if run, which reported no change to
them once `countIPv6` was declared. If a future what-if shows one of them as a
`Modify`, treat it the way this one was treated.

## 11. Alerts go to Slack, and info-level is dropped

**Current.** Alertmanager posts to `#webservices-alerts` via a Slack webhook. The
webhook URL comes from Key Vault through an `ExternalSecret` and is read with
`slack_api_url_file`, so it never appears in the values file or in the rendered
config Secret.

**Why there was nothing before.** The chart's default config routes every alert to
a receiver named `"null"`. With 155 chart-shipped rules plus the governance ones,
roughly 158 alert rules were firing into it — the platform looked instrumented and
delivered nothing.

**`info` is dropped, deliberately.** On a single-node cluster the info-level rules
are mostly steady-state noise, and the fastest way to make a new alerting channel
useless is to fill it on day one. `critical` gets its own route with a 1h repeat;
`warning` groups on the 12h default. `Watchdog` goes to `"null"` — it fires
constantly by design and only matters if you are checking that the pipeline itself
works. Raising `info` back up is a one-line change once the channel is quiet.

**Setting `config` replaces the chart default wholesale**, so the four inhibit
rules are carried over by hand rather than inherited. They are what stops one
critical alert dragging its warning and info siblings along. Dropping them would
not error — it would just get noisy.

## What the rules actually watch

A receiver alone would have delivered 155 generic Kubernetes alerts and still
nothing about this platform's own controls, all of which fail quietly:
`governance/platform-health.yaml` adds five rules for exactly those.

| Alert | The quiet failure it catches |
|---|---|
| `ExternalSecretNotReady` | The Secret keeps serving its last synced value, so the workload runs fine until a rotation or rebuild |
| `VeleroBackupFailing` | Backups erroring; only matters when a restore is needed |
| `VeleroNoRecentBackup` | Worse — not failing, just not running |
| `PostgresWALArchivingFailing` | The database serves queries perfectly while archiving nothing |
| `ArgoCDAppNotSynced` | GitOps stopped converging, so every control in this repo quietly stops being enforced |

**Metric names were cross-checked against the committed dashboards**, not written
from memory. That caught one: the archiver metric is `cnpg_pg_stat_archiver_*`, not
`cnpg_collector_pg_stat_archiver_*` — a plausible-looking name that would never
match, giving a rule that looks healthy and never fires.

**A rule goes silent when its exporter does, and that is not obvious.** Every rule
above needs its series to *exist*: `== 1`, `increase()` and `time() - metric` all
return nothing when the metric is absent, so the alert cannot fire at the moment the
component it watches disappears. `VeleroNoRecentBackup` was the clearest case —
Velero uninstalled, crashed, or never having completed a backup all produced no
series and therefore no alert.

The chart's `TargetDown` is the generic net, but it is `warning`-severity, needs
more than 10% of a job's targets down, and cannot fire at all if the ServiceMonitor
itself is gone. So the two cases where *absence is itself the failure* get an
explicit companion:

- **`VeleroBackupMetricsAbsent`** — `absent_over_time(...[48h])`. It fires on a
  fresh cluster until the first 02:00 run, which is correct rather than a false
  positive: no backup has succeeded, so backup alerting really is blind. The
  window covers a series that existed and vanished; a series that has **never**
  existed is reported from the first evaluation, so only `for:` delays anything.
  Sizing `for:` to cover install-to-first-backup would be ~26h, which would also
  delay a real Velero outage by 26h — not worth it.
- **`ArgoCDMetricsAbsent`** — the more useful of the two, because it also catches
  the scrape breaking rather than ArgoCD breaking. That ServiceMonitor selects on
  labels the *upstream* ArgoCD manifest owns, which can change on an upgrade.

**`VeleroBackupMetricsAbsent` stays `critical`, but does not repeat hourly.** It
fires on every fresh install, which is correct — no backup has succeeded, so the
backup path really is blind — but the `critical` route repeats every hour, so a
worst-case install-to-first-backup window would have produced around 26 Slack posts
for an expected condition. That is how a channel gets muted, and a muted channel
looks exactly like coverage.

Downgrading to `warning` was the alternative and was rejected: on a cluster that has
been up for weeks, a blind backup path is not a warning, and there is no other
signal for it. So the severity stays honest and the *notification* is what changes —
an explicit route ahead of the critical one gives both absence alerts a 12h repeat.

The distinction that justifies it: these describe a **standing condition**, not an
incident. Hourly re-notification tells you nothing new whether the cause is an
install an hour old or an outage a month old. Anything else `critical` keeps the 1h
repeat.

Read these as "the rule above has gone blind", not as the underlying fault. They
deliberately do not suppress their siblings: the chart's inhibit rules match on
`alertname`, so a firing `VeleroBackupMetricsAbsent` still lets
`VeleroBackupFailing` through if it can fire at all.

**ESO and CNPG deliberately do not get one.** Their failures surface elsewhere — a
workload breaks on the next rotation, and `TargetDown` covers the endpoint — so a
companion each would add noise for little signal. The CNPG case is the weaker
argument of the two: archiving could fail while the exporter is also down. The
better fix there is a staleness rule on
`cnpg_pg_stat_archiver_seconds_since_last_archival` (a metric the dashboards
already use), which detects the actual bad state rather than the monitoring gap —
but it needs to know whether `archive_timeout` is set, or an idle database will
false-alarm. Left open rather than guessed.

`argocd_app_info` is the exception with no corroboration in the repo, because
**ArgoCD was not being scraped at all** — it ships metrics Services and no
ServiceMonitor, so `governance/servicemonitor-argocd.yaml` adds one. Confirm that
rule has a target before trusting it (install.md §11).

## 12. GitOps is ArgoCD, not Flux

**Settled.** Evaluated on 2026-08-12 and re-checked on 2026-08-22 against the
running cluster. Flux is a good tool; it is not the right one for *this* design.
**Why.** The multi-tenancy model is the whole argument. An `AppProject` expresses,
in one file a reviewer reads top to bottom, that a project may deploy **only these
kinds**, **only into its own namespaces**, **only from its own repo** — and names
the escalation paths it excludes. That file is labelled the security boundary
because it is: projects run their own GitOps repos that nobody on the infra side
reviews, so the whitelist is the only thing between a commit in their repo and the
cluster.

Flux isolates differently: a `Kustomization` impersonates a ServiceAccount and
RBAC does the rest. Reaching the same result means per-project ServiceAccounts and
Roles enumerating allowed verbs and kinds, and depending on
`spec.serviceAccountName` being set correctly on every `Kustomization`. Two
consequences:

- **Kind allowlisting through RBAC is scattered and easier to get subtly wrong.**
  "No `ExternalSecret`, no `SealedSecret`, no `RoleBinding`" stops being one
  reviewable list.
- **The source-repo restriction largely disappears.** RBAC constrains *what* is
  applied, not *where it came from*. The `sourceRepos` pin has no Flux
  counterpart; you would rely on only infra committing the `GitRepository`.

That second point is the sharper one, and worth conceding openly if challenged:
this design deliberately keeps repo-origin and applied-kinds as two independent
controls, and Flux collapses them into one.

The same reasoning covers `project-infra`, the privileged lane, whose own comment
warns that its RoleBinding + `namespace: '*'` combination is the escalation path
in this cluster. Under Flux both lanes are `Kustomization` objects separated only
by which ServiceAccount they impersonate — a less legible separation for exactly
the object that can mint RoleBindings anywhere.

**Where Flux would have been fine or better**, stated because conceding it
strengthens the rest:

- **ApplicationSet is genuinely awkward.** `gitops-appset.yaml` needs a matrix
  generator, `elementsYaml` and a `templatePatch` purely because
  `syncPolicy.automated` is presence-based and cannot be conditionally templated.
  Flux's per-project `Kustomization` files would be plainer, at the cost of one
  file per project-environment instead of one generator.
- **Helm handling.** Flux's `HelmRelease` performs a real `helm install/upgrade`;
  ArgoCD renders and applies. The handover story in
  [argocd.md](argocd.md) — capture hand edits with `helm get values` — would be
  slightly more natural under Flux.

**One argument that has since reversed.** The 2026-08-12 assessment noted that
running ArgoCD with no GUI forfeits its main advantage. That changed when project
teams asked to see their own sync status: ArgoCD has a first-party UI that
integrates with the existing Dex, and Flux has none (Weave GitOps is third-party
and lost its corporate backing). What was a point against ArgoCD is now a point
for it.

**Migration cost, if it is ever asked.** `Application` and `ApplicationSet`
objects would be mechanical to convert. The `AppProject`s would need a from-scratch
RBAC redesign. Stating that plainly is better than claiming there is no lock-in.

## 13. The `default` AppProject is emptied

**Current.** `k8s/argocd/projects/default.yaml` overrides ArgoCD's built-in
`default` project with empty `sourceRepos`, `destinations`,
`clusterResourceWhitelist` and `namespaceResourceWhitelist`.

**Why.** ArgoCD creates `default` at startup permitting **any repo, any
namespace, and every cluster-scoped kind**, and it *cannot be deleted* — upstream
documents that it may be modified but not removed, and recommends emptying it in
multi-tenant setups. Left alone it is a fully permissive project sitting beside
the AppProject whitelist that entry 12 identifies as the entire security boundary.

**It was not a live escalation when this was written**, and the entry records that
so a future reader does not over-read it: no Application referenced `default` (23
on `infra`, 2 on `project-infra`), and project developers cannot create
Applications at all — verified by impersonation. The point is that "nobody uses
it" is a weaker guarantee than "it cannot be used", and the cost of the stronger
one is a nine-line file.

**Consequence, by design.** Any Application that omits `spec.project`, or names
`default` explicitly, now fails to sync instead of deploying with unrestricted
permissions. That is the intended behaviour: project assignment becomes
deliberate. An Application that suddenly cannot sync after this lands is telling
you it never named a project.


## 14. Projects read their own ArgoCD status via Kubernetes RBAC, not an ArgoCD UI

**Current.** A project that wants to see whether ArgoCD is syncing its manifests
gets a `Role` in the `argocd` namespace scoped with `resourceNames` to its own
`Application` objects, bound to its GitHub team. There is no ArgoCD web UI, and
`argocd-server` is not exposed. The template is
`k8s/projects/_template/infra/argocd-status-rbac.yaml.example`; it is opt-in, and
a project without it sees nothing in `argocd` at all.

**Why this and not the UI.** Projects could already see the *effects* of a sync —
Deployments, Pods and Events in their own namespaces, through Headlamp. What they
could not see is a sync that is **failing**, which is the case that matters: a
stalled sync looks exactly like "nothing has happened yet". Verified by
impersonation before this landed: a project developer got `no` for `get`, `list`
and `watch` on `applications.argoproj.io`.

Exposing the ArgoCD UI behind Dex would also answer it, and `install.md` had
always left that door open. It was not taken because it costs a new public
endpoint, a second authorisation model (`argocd-rbac-cm`, currently empty, with
an unrestricted break-glass `admin` account) and per-project RBAC lines that must
be generated during onboarding or silently drift. The RBAC route reuses the
identity and the tool projects already have.

**The limitation, stated plainly: `kubectl get app -n argocd` is Forbidden.**
Kubernetes RBAC cannot filter a collection, so `resourceNames` does not restrict
`list` — it only permits `get` on named objects. A developer must therefore name
the Application:

```
kubectl get app -n argocd project-infra-<project> \
  -o custom-columns='SYNC:.status.sync.status,HEALTH:.status.health.status'
```

The alternative was granting unscoped `list`, which would expose every project's
Application to every project. A label selector does not help — the filtering is
client-side and the request is refused before it. The same applies in Headlamp,
which lists resources: the Application will not appear in a list view.

**Consequence.** `project-infra` gains `Role` in its
`namespaceResourceWhitelist`, alongside the `RoleBinding` it already had. That
widens the cluster's most privileged AppProject by one kind, which is why the
Role is written per project with explicit `resourceNames` rather than as a shared
ClusterRole: a Role grants no more than the verbs written in it, and only inside
its own namespace. Verbs are `get` and `watch` only — not `patch`, not `delete`,
so a project cannot trigger or abort its own sync. Confirmed by impersonation,
including that another project's team is refused.

**Revisit if** projects ask for the diff view or a self-service sync button.
Those are real arguments for the UI, and the per-project `resourceNames` work
done here is not wasted if it is built.

## 15. The node pool is pinned to one availability zone

**Current.** `infra/aks.bicep` sets `zones: ['1']`. The pool was previously
`['1','2','3']`.

**Why.** Azure managed disks **cannot cross availability zones**. A multi-zone
pool spreads nodes, so a replacement node can land in a different zone from the
one holding the cluster's disks — and every pod with a PVC then becomes
permanently unschedulable, not transiently. `WaitForFirstConsumer` on the
StorageClass is correct and does not prevent this: it places each disk in
whatever zone its pod first landed in, which is right at creation time and
useless once that node is gone.

**Found the hard way, 2026-08-24.** A node-image upgrade replaced the single
zone-1 node with a zone-2 node. All six existing disks (telemetry store, Loki,
Grafana, Prometheus, Alertmanager, the Postgres primary) stayed pinned to zone 1,
and their pods sat `Pending` with *"node(s) didn't match PersistentVolume's node
affinity"* until a second node was added back in zone 1. **Scaling *up* is safe;
scaling *down* is destructive**, because Azure chooses which node to remove and
it may be the one whose zone holds the data.

**What is given up.** Nothing that exists today. Zonal redundancy needs more than
one node to mean anything, so a multi-zone pool on a single-node cluster buys
fragility without buying availability. Revisit when the node count grows enough
for zonal HA to be real — and note that at that point stateful workloads need to
be zone-aware or replicated regardless, because the disk constraint does not go
away.

**Which zone does not matter.** `D4s_v6` is offered in all three zones in
`swedencentral` with no restrictions, and pricing is identical. Zone `1` was
chosen only because the cluster's existing disks are already there.

⚠️ **Logical zone numbers are per-subscription aliases, not physical
datacentres.** For this subscription:

| Logical (Bicep, `kubectl`) | Physical (Azure status page) |
|---|---|
| 1 | `swedencentral-az3` |
| 2 | `swedencentral-az1` |
| 3 | `swedencentral-az2` |

This matters when reading an Azure outage notice, which reports **physical**
zones: a reported problem in `az3` is *this cluster's* zone 1. It would also
matter if resources were ever split across subscriptions — matching zone numbers
would not co-locate them. Re-read the live mapping with
`az rest --method get --uri ".../locations?api-version=2022-12-01"` and look at
`availabilityZoneMappings`.

## 16. Node-image upgrades stay automatic, and the shared Postgres has no PDB

**Current.** `nodeOSUpgradeChannel: 'NodeImage'` in `infra/aks.bicep`, and
`enablePDB: false` on the shared CloudNativePG cluster.

**Why automatic, having been burned by it.** On 2026-08-24 an automatic
node-image upgrade left the test cluster's pool in `provisioningState: Failed`,
billing two nodes, and appeared to break SSO. Moving to a manual channel was
implemented and then **rejected**: this platform is maintained by volunteers,
node images ship roughly weekly carrying OS CVE fixes, and a manual step that is
forgotten is worse than an automatic one that occasionally disrupts. **The right
response was to make the disruption survivable, not to move it into a runbook
nobody runs.**

**Why the drain wedged, and why the PDB goes.** CNPG creates a
`PodDisruptionBudget` selecting `cnpg.io/instanceRole: primary` — it protects
whichever pod is currently primary, always exactly one. At `instances: 1` that
makes `disruptionsAllowed` permanently `0`: **no eviction is ever allowed, and
every node drain blocks forever.** AKS retries rather than forcing, emitting
`Eviction blocked by Too Many Requests (usually a pdb): shared-1` — 67 times over
7 minutes in a controlled reproduction. Setting `enablePDB: false` unblocked the
stuck deletion immediately.

Nothing real is given up. A PDB exists to stop Kubernetes evicting the primary
while a replica catches up; with one instance there is no replica, so the
guarantee was already vacuous — it blocked drains without protecting anything.
Postgres still shuts down gracefully (`terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 1800`),
which is what AKS waits for. Upstream CNPG documents `enablePDB: false` as
advisable for non-production clusters.

**`instances: 2` is the alternative fix, not a complement.** It also makes the
PDB satisfiable, and adds real availability — at the cost of a second attached
disk (one of ~6 remaining) and 1Gi more reserved memory. Measured on the test
cluster: actual usage was ~8m CPU and 217Mi per instance, so the cost is the disk
slot rather than compute. Revisit when the node count or the availability
requirement grows.

**This decision depends on [entry 15](#15-the-node-pool-is-pinned-to-one-availability-zone).** Automatic upgrades are only
survivable because the pool is pinned to one zone; a replacement node in another
zone strands every disk-bound workload permanently, and no PDB setting helps.

**Dex keeps its signing keys, so an upgrade no longer logs everyone out.** With
the previous `storage: type: memory`, every Dex restart generated a new signing
key and **invalidated every issued token** — and the resulting `401` was
indistinguishable from a broken authenticator, which produced two wrong
diagnoses. `storage: type: kubernetes` persists the keys as custom resources in
etcd. Verified on the test cluster: the JWKS `kid` was identical across a full
`rollout restart`.

It costs **no PVC and no attached disk** — the store is etcd, reached through the
API server. The chart already shipped the ServiceAccount, the ClusterRole
(`create` on `customresourcedefinitions`) and the namespace Role
(`dex.coreos.com/*`); those permissions were simply unused. Dex creates its own
ten CRDs at startup.

**What it puts in etcd.** Refresh tokens become `refreshtokens.dex.coreos.com`
objects in the `dex` namespace — real credentials in cluster state. Only the Dex
ServiceAccount can read them; a project developer gets `no` (verified by
impersonation), since project `admin` does not reach the `dex` namespace. It also
makes a second Dex replica possible for the first time, because both would share
auth-code state — not done here, but no longer blocked.

**When a `401` still happens**, compare the token's `kid` against Dex's live JWKS
before suspecting anything else ([maintenance.md](maintenance.md)). Keys now
survive restarts, but a token older than a key *rotation* still fails, and that
check distinguishes it from a real fault in seconds.

## 17. The telemetry store is named for its job, and "MinIO" is reserved

**Current.** The `telemetry-store` namespace holds an object store that exists to
give Loki and Thanos the S3-compatible API they require, and holds only the `loki`
and `thanos` buckets. It is not offered to projects.

**It runs MinIO, but it is not called MinIO — and that is the point.** People read
"there is MinIO in the cluster" as "there is S3 storage I can use", and they are
right to: naming a service after its software is an offer of that software.
Stating the scope next to the name did not prevent the misreading: the name is
read, the sentence after it is skimmed. So the service is named for its *job*
instead, and the name **MinIO is deliberately kept free** for a project-facing
object store, to be built when a project first needs one — see *Revisit when*
below. The software is still MinIO and the charts, images and upstream labels
still say so; what changed is that the platform no longer *offers* something
called MinIO that nobody may use.

**A project-facing object store will simply be called `minio`** — the same way the
shared database is called PostgreSQL rather than something abstract. A product
name is the right name for a thing projects may actually use: it tells them what
API to expect and what documentation to read. The rule is not "avoid product
names", it is **name a service after the software only when projects can use it**.
That is exactly why the telemetry store is not called MinIO, and why a project
store would be.

**The reason it is closed to projects is the backup assumption, not the disk
space.** Everything in the store today is *derived* — metrics and logs Prometheus
and Loki have already flushed.
That is what justifies excluding the namespace from the daily Velero schedule.
Project state is not derived, so putting it there would make an accepted risk
wrong **without anything reporting that it had changed** — and the failure mode
is that the data sits in no backup path at all: not Velero (namespace excluded),
not Barman (Postgres only).

Two further blockers, either of which would need solving first: there is no
per-project credential (the install writes a single root user/password to Key
Vault), and the store is a single replica on one PVC that Loki, Thanos and the
backup flow all already depend on.

**Revisit when** a project genuinely needs object-storage semantics — an S3 SDK,
blobs, versioning — rather than somewhere to keep a few KB. That is two pieces of
work, not one: per-project credentials **and** a backup story this store does not
have today. The trap is building it *because MinIO is already installed*; that
reasoning is what would put project data on the observability volume. A second,
separate instance is the honest answer, not converting this one — and it is the
one that gets to be called `minio`.

**What building it would take**, so this does not need investigating again. The
deployment itself is the easy half — copy the shape of `telemetry-store.yaml` and
`k8s/infra-manifest/telemetry-store/`, which is one Application, a values file and a
bucket-creation Job. Sizing follows the disk-tier rule: an exact E-tier PVC on
`disk-standardssd`, and it **costs one of the ~6 remaining attached disks**
unless it is put on `files-shared` instead. Two traps are already solved in the
existing install and must be carried over, not rediscovered: the chart's built-in
`buckets:` provisioning uses a Helm post-install hook that ArgoCD skips when the
first sync is not clean, so buckets silently never appear — use a standalone
idempotent Job; and the chart's own `metrics.serviceMonitor` hardcodes
`release: <release-name>`, which our Prometheus ignores, so the ServiceMonitor
must be a plain manifest.

The work that does **not** exist yet, and is the real cost:

- **Per-project users and bucket policies.** Today the install writes a single
  root credential to Key Vault; there is no per-tenant identity of any kind.
  This needs `mc admin user add` plus a policy per project in the provisioning
  Job, and credential delivery through ExternalSecret or SealedSecret with the
  same opt-in discipline the Key Vault store uses.
- **Deciding the backup posture deliberately.** The daily Velero schedule is
  `includedNamespaces: "*"` **minus an exclusion list**, so a new namespace is
  backed up by default — the opposite of the `telemetry-store` namespace's
  situation, which is excluded by name. That default is right here, but it must
  be a decision rather than an accident, and PVC snapshots of project blobs are
  not free.
- **An ingress, if projects need presigned URLs or browser uploads.** The store is
  in-cluster only today (no ingress by choice). Adding one is a Traefik
  IngressRoute plus a certificate, and it makes the store publicly reachable —
  which is a different security question from anything the store answers today.

**The strongest argument for building it is the billing model, not the API.**
Its cost is the PVC underneath it — fixed, and paid once by the platform. S3
calls against it are in-cluster traffic and cost nothing per operation, whereas
`files-shared` bills every write and list ([entry
16](#18-persistent-state-has-four-tiers-and-a-disk-is-the-last-one)). For a
write-heavy project on a centrally-paid cluster that difference is the whole
decision: a workload that would cost tens of euros a month on `files-shared`
costs nothing extra here beyond the disk already provisioned. It also puts a
single reviewable number on the shared bill instead of a per-project variable one
nobody is watching.

**Where it sits in the four tiers ([entry 18](#18-persistent-state-has-four-tiers-and-a-disk-is-the-last-one)): it is not a fifth tier, it is a
narrower one.** For "somewhere to keep files" the answer stays `files-shared` — it
is already RWX, already backed up, and costs no attached disk. A project-facing
object store is only the right answer when the application genuinely speaks S3:
an SDK, presigned URLs, versioned objects, or a library that has no filesystem
mode. That is a real requirement when it appears, and it is the *only* case that
justifies the work above.

## 18. Persistent state has four tiers, and a disk is the last one

**Current.** A project needing state that survives pod restarts has four
options. They are ordered by cost, and the smallest need has the cheapest
answer:

| Need | Use | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| A few KB, key-value | ConfigMap or Secret + a scoped ServiceAccount | zero |
| Structured, queryable, transactional | the shared PostgreSQL | zero — already onboarded |
| Files, a few MB to GB | a `files-shared` PVC (RWX) | zero attached disks |
| High-IOPS block storage | a `disk-*` PVC | one of a small, fixed pool |

**Why this needs stating.** `hostPath` was the obvious answer on the previous
platform and is now rejected at admission by baseline Pod Security (decision 3) —
correctly, since a hostPath pod reaches the node. Without a stated alternative
the next reflex is a `disk-*` PVC, and **attached disks are the cluster's
binding scaling limit**, not CPU or memory: a `Standard_D4s_v6` node takes 12,
and the platform's own components already hold 6.

**`files-shared` does not consume that budget.** It is backed by
`file.csi.azure.com` — an SMB share over the network, not a block device attached
to the VM — so the disk ceiling does not apply to it. It is also
`ReadWriteMany`, so unlike `hostPath` it survives the pod moving to another node.

**It is Azure-backed, and that is a real tension with "portable by intent".** The
mitigation is the same one the `disk-*` classes already use: the platform owns
the StorageClass and gives it a **neutral name**, so a project's PVC says
`files-shared` and never `azurefile-csi`. Moving to another platform is then a
change to one StorageClass object rather than an edit to every project's repo,
and it joins the short list in [Portability](../README.md#portability) instead of
spreading through `k8s/`.

**That is a mitigation, not an escape, so the tier is offered rather than
pushed.** A shared filesystem on another platform is a different implementation
with different semantics, not a drop-in — the class name survives a move, the
performance and locking behaviour may not. Reach for it when files are genuinely
the right shape for the data; prefer the shared PostgreSQL, which is already
portable by construction, whenever the data would fit there.

**Cost is a shared concern, not the project's.** Almost every project on this
cluster is paid centrally, so a project cannot feel the price of its own storage
choice — the guidance here has to carry the weight the invoice does not. Two of
the four tiers bill in a way that a project would not predict:

| Tier | How it bills |
|---|---|
| ConfigMap / PostgreSQL | no marginal cost — already provisioned |
| `files-shared` | **per GB used *and per operation*** |
| `disk-*` | fixed per E-tier, regardless of use; transactions negligible |

**`files-shared` is the cheap tier for storage and the expensive one for
traffic**, and the crossover is lower than it looks. Storage is roughly a tenth
of a `disk-*` PVC's price and bills only what is used rather than the whole
provisioned tier. But writes and lists are billed per 10k operations, so a
fixed 32Gi `disk-*` PVC costs the same as about **370,000 `files-shared`
operations a month** — around 0.14 writes a second, sustained. Below that, files
is much cheaper; above it, the disk is.

In practice that means state-shaped access is fine and request-shaped access is
not. A checkpoint written every 30 seconds is cents a month. Session state
written once per request at 5 req/s is roughly **$85 a month** against $2.40 for
the disk it replaced — and nothing warns anyone, because it appears only on a
central invoice nobody reads per project. **Ask how often it is written, not just
how big it is.**

**Limits worth knowing before choosing:**

- A ConfigMap or Secret is capped at **1 MiB** by the API server, and every write
  goes through etcd and rewrites the whole object. Suits small state written
  occasionally; not a write-per-request store. Stay well under the cap rather
  than approaching it, and use a Secret rather than a ConfigMap when the content
  is sensitive.
- `files-shared` is SMB: higher latency, weaker file locking, no `O_DIRECT`. Fine
  for state and config files. **Do not put a SQLite database on it** — that
  combination corrupts under lock contention. Use the shared PostgreSQL instead.
- **Nothing warns you when the disk pool runs out.** The node does not publish
  `attachable-volumes-azure-disk` in `Allocatable`, so the limit is enforced by
  Azure at attach time, not by the scheduler. It surfaces as a pod stuck
  starting, not as a scheduling failure.

**ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding stay infra-granted.** The ConfigMap tier
needs them, and they are excluded from the project GitOps whitelist deliberately
— a ServiceAccount mints an identity (decision 8). Infra commits them under
`k8s/projects/PROJECT/infra/`, the same Layer 1 route as a database. The Role
should name the object with `resourceNames`, so the app can write its own state
and nothing else.

**There is no object-storage tier, and that is deliberate.** For files, the
`files-shared` row above is the answer. A project-facing S3 store would be a
narrower tier than that one, not an extra option beside it — only right when an
application genuinely speaks S3 rather than wanting somewhere to keep files.
[Entry 17](#17-the-telemetry-store-is-named-for-its-job-and-minio-is-reserved)
records what standing one up would cost.

See [onboarding.md](onboarding.md) for the recipes.

## 19. Metric retention is sized from a measured rate, and `0` is not unlimited

**Current.** Thanos keeps raw blocks 10 days, 5-minute downsamples 90 days and
1-hour downsamples 180 days. The telemetry store's PVC is 64Gi (E6). The
`weekly-full` Velero schedule keeps backups 90 days.

**The numbers come from a measurement, not a guess.** Taken from the live J26
cluster on 2026-09-05 — a single-node AKS cluster running the same
Prometheus/Loki stack:

| | Measured |
|---|---|
| Active series | 109 165 |
| Prometheus TSDB on disk | 14.8 GiB |
| Covering | 16 days |
| **Rate** | **≈0.93 GiB/day** |

At that rate the previous settings did not fit. Raw retention of 30 days is
~28 GiB on its own, against a 32Gi bucket that must also hold the 5m tier, the
1h tier and Loki's chunks. **A full bucket stops accepting writes, and metric
ingestion then stops silently** — so the sizing has to be deliberate rather than
optimistic.

**Treat 0.93 GiB/day as a floor.** It was measured after the event, with the
cluster quiet; during the camp it was certainly higher. Re-measure before a
large event rather than trusting this row.

**Raw resolution is the expensive tier and the least useful one.** Cutting it
from 30d to 10d frees ~18 GiB. What survives a late discovery is the 5-minute
tier, which is why that one keeps the full 90 days.

### The trap this entry exists to prevent

`0` means opposite things in the two halves of this stack:

| Setting | `0` means |
|---|---|
| Prometheus `retention.time` | use the default — **15 days** |
| Prometheus `retention.size` | unlimited |
| Thanos `--retention.resolution-*` | keep forever |

"0 means unlimited" is right for two of these and destructive for the third —
and the first two sit in the same config block, one line apart.

**This is not hypothetical.** On the J26 cluster `retention.time=0d` was set
intending "keep everything". It resolved to the 15-day default, and because it
was applied 15 days after the camp ended, every metric from the event was
deleted. The disk was 24% full: nothing ran out, and nothing alerted. The loss
was found a month later, by which point the data was long gone.

**Why this cluster would have survived it.** Prometheus retention governs only
the local window here — the Thanos sidecar has already uploaded the blocks to
object storage, and the compactor's retention is a separate setting that the
change would not have touched. A month after the event the 5-minute tier would
still have held the whole camp.

### Retention is not an archive

The longest tier is 180 days. A project whose metrics must outlive that needs a
deliberate export when the project ends. **Do not solve it by raising
retention**: the tiers are sized to the bucket, and an unbounded tier fills it
and stops ingestion for every project on the cluster.

**Backups are sized to discovery latency, not to RPO.** `weekly-full` went from
35 to 90 days because the loss of an infra PVC is typically noticed weeks after
it happens, and a 35-day window can expire before anyone looks. The J26 loss was
found after a month — inside 90 days, outside 35.

## 20. A test cluster that outlives its install gets its own durable resources

**Current.** A test cluster kept running alongside the real one is given its own
durable resource group — its own Key Vault, backup storage account and audit
workspace. It shares nothing with production but the subscription.

**Why: three things collide, and two of them destroy data.**

- **Postgres backups land in the same path.** Both clusters run a CNPG `Cluster`
  named `shared` writing to the `cnpg-shared` container under the same
  `serverName`. Two different PostgreSQL instances, one Barman path, different
  system identifiers. The `serverName` set in entry 19's wake protects a
  *rebuild*; it does nothing for two clusters running at once.
- **Velero expires backups it did not create.** The `BackupStorageLocation` has
  no `prefix`, so both clusters write to the root of the `velero` container —
  and each one syncs that location and deletes whatever is past its TTL. The
  test cluster would delete the real cluster's backups.
- **The GitHub OAuth secrets are per-hostname.** One OAuth app has one callback
  URL, so test and production need different apps. Sharing a vault means the
  production install writes its client secret over the key the test cluster
  reads, and the test cluster's SSO stops working.

Sharing the vault would also hand both clusters the **same Sealed Secrets private
key**, so a `SealedSecret` committed for one decrypts in the other.

**Why separate resources rather than separate names.** Every durable value is
already an install-time input, in one of three forms:

| Form | Values |
|---|---|
| Runbook variables (`install.md` §0) | `$INFRA_RG`, `$KEY_VAULT_NAME`, `$BACKUP_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, `$LOG_WORKSPACE` |
| Manifest placeholders, filled in §9 | `<KEY_VAULT_NAME>`, `<BACKUP_STORAGE_ACCOUNT>`, `<INFRA_RG>` |
| Bicep params, overridden on the CLI | `auditWorkspaceName`, `auditWorkspaceResourceGroup` |

The third row is the one that catches people: the audit workspace is pinned in
`webservices.bicepparam`, not templated, so a test cluster must override both of
its params alongside `clusterName` — which is why §7a says three, not one.

Pointing a test cluster at its own resources therefore costs no code change, and
the production install stays exactly as documented.

**Rejected: one shared vault with `-test` suffixed keys.** That plus a Velero
prefix plus a distinct `serverName` is three separate patches rather than one
boundary, and each can be undone later by an operator writing to the wrong key.

**Rejected: sharing the durable RG and being careful.** "Careful" is not a
control. The failure mode is silent in all three cases — a backup that overwrites
another, a deletion that looks like retention, a secret that is simply the wrong
value.

**Cost, accepted.** One extra storage account and one extra vault for as long as
the test cluster lives. Both are deleted with its resource group.

**Authentication is not a reason to share.** A managed identity accepts many
federated credentials, so one identity could serve both clusters. That makes
sharing *possible*, not advisable.
